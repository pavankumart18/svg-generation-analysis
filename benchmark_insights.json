    "openai-gpt-5.2-pro leads the benchmark due to its consistently high scores in prompt adherence, structural accuracy, completeness, and coherence, indicating robust SVG generation capabilities and strong overall reliability.",
    "All models demonstrate a significant weakness in the 'Physics' criterion, with even the top performers scoring notably lower here than in other categories, suggesting a general difficulty in rendering physically plausible SVG scenes.",
    "The 'Physics' criterion exhibits the greatest variance across models, with scores ranging from the low 60s for the best models to below 30 for the lowest performers, highlighting it as the most challenging aspect of SVG generation.",
    "Prompt difficulty impacts model performance: whimsical or complex prompts (e.g., 'moose conducting a carousel', 'peacock spinning a pottery wheel') tend to produce wider score disparities, indicating that creative and less conventional scenarios are harder for most models.",
    "Models from the same vendor (e.g., OpenAI or Google) show incremental improvements between versions, but no single vendor dominates every prompt, suggesting that prompt-specific strengths and weaknesses persist across architectures.",
    "Recommendation: Focus future model development on improving physical plausibility in SVG outputs, and expand training data to better cover complex, imaginative prompts to reduce variance and improve overall robustness."

The task combines recognizable forms (octopus, pipe organ) and clear relationships, making it easier for models to generate coherent SVGs. Minor differences in how models interpreted the interaction and detail level led to the spread in scores.",
